# pz-translation-data

Provides a dataset for translations of Project Zomboid with the different parameters and properties as well as possible filenames.

> 💡 **Tip:** If the schema fails to load, you may need to add GitHub to your **[Trusted Domains](.github/Troubleshooting_Trusted_Domains.md)**.

# Contributing

To contribute to the dataset, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - Linux/Mac: `source .venv/bin/activate`
    - Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Install pre-commit hooks:
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

This will format the singular JSON files on each commit, which are used to allow for a single source of truth for all translation files. The smaller JSON files are easier to manage and work with during development.
